## v1.0.0-pre.3

- Fix Scene attach behaviour, add appropriate CSS as relevant (see README)
- Allow longform size attributes, and shortform "RS" for "renderSize" (see README)
- BREAKING CHANGE (who's using this already?).  The size separator is now
  a semicolon (";"), and relative separator a comma (","), e.g.
  `size="absolute: 10; relative: 0.5,-10; renderSize"` or abbreviated form.
