# Support

Famous-views is still a pre-release.  As is Famous.  These are both very new technologies,
very different to what you've used before, and may take some time to master.  Adequate
preparation can save you a lot of frustration further down the line.
There are some great **Tutorials** below which will introduce you to the basic concepts
and help you build your first app.  We're working on our own
[FView University](https://fview-lab.meteor.com/fview-team), which is not finished yet
but has some of the Famous University lessons made for Famous-Views.
*It's critical that you understand **Famous** before trying to understand
Famous-Views*.  If you're just **starting off**, a good first read is
[Tutas-Labs Part 4](http://www.tutas-labs.com/famous-meteor-integration-part-4/)
which introduces *Surfaces, Views and Modifiers*.

We *strongly suggest* going through the
[Famo.us University](http://famo.us/university/home/#/) and to be aware of the
[Famo.us Reference Docs](http://famo.us/docs/reference/).
Beyond that, try go through all the examples on this site and refer back to them.  But in
particular, **make sure you've read** the [FAQ](/faq), and are aware of the
[API Docs](/features/api) and [Views README](/views/README).  If you're struggling
with something, please make sure you've checked for an answer in one of these 3 places
before asking for help.

## Questions

Even though it's early days, we still have a proportionately impressive community who
are keen to help.  **You can help too**, by helping others in these places.  This is
a great way of *giving back to the community*, and is appreciated even more so than
monetary contributions (many of us have full time jobs already).

* [Gitter Live Chat](http://github.com/gadicc/meteor-famous-views) for famous-views
* [forums.famous-views.org](http://forums.famous-views.org/)
* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/famous-views) with the
`[famous-views]` tag (COMING SOON)
* [GitHub Issue Page](https://github.com/gadicc/meteor-famous-views/issues) on our
repo with a [Q] tag if you still have no luck

As usage increases, we may consider setting up a discourse forum.  Discussion
is here: https://github.com/gadicc/meteor-famous-views/issues/250.

## Tutorials

These tutorials both introduce you to basic concepts and help you build a sample app
from start to finish!
