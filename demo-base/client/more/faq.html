          It would be great but very inefficient for us to emulate Meteor's
          behaviour exactly.  Note that as per the
          <a href="http://famo.us/guides/pitfalls">Famo.us Pitfalls</a>
          guide, pinging the DOM <i>is really bad practice</i> and can cause
          performance problems in your app.  Two easy workarounds:

          <ol>
            <li><b>Use <code>this.$()</code> instead</b> - since although your
            template is not in the DOM yet, it is part of the DOM range in
            your template instance.  <i>This is much faster too</i>.</li>

            <li><b>Wrap your code in
            <code>window.requestAnimationFrame()</code></b>,
            if you need your DIV to be "fully rendered", i.e., not just on the
            DOM, but updated by Famous too.  This is because Famo.us buffers
            changes for performance, and this way you'll ensure your code runs
            after the commit.  <i>Avoid if possible.</i></li>
          </ol>

          See <a href="https://github.com/gadicc/meteor-famous-views/issues/89">issue #89</a>.
          In brief you have probably <code>FastClick</code> installed twice
          (once via Meteor and once via Famous) and you should remove one
          of them.  See the issue for more info.
