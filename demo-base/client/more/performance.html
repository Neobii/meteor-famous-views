# Performance

Famous promised you 60fps, but it's a group effort.  It's important to follow all
the performance guidelines for your app to avoid jitter and lag.

First off, it's *critical* for you to read Famo.us'
[Pitfalls and Gotchas](http://famo.us/docs/reference/pages/0.3/pitfalls-and-gotchas.html),
e.g. certain CSS properties will *ruin your animations*, touching the DOM *is a killer*, etc.

Next, familiarize yourself with the guidelines below.

## Using the DOM

You know already to avoid it, but if you have to, do it via Meteor's
[templateInstance](http://docs.meteor.com/#/full/template_inst)
functions which are scoped to their template and hence much faster.  e.g.

{{/markdown}}

{{#snippet lang="javascript"}}
  Template.example.onRendered(function() {
    var wrong = $('div.class');      // &lt;-- No!!  Bad!!
    var right = this.$('div.class'); // &lt;-- Yes!  Better!
  });
{{/snippet}}

{{#markdown}}

## Timers

Never use `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, etc!  Make sure to either use Famo.us' versions
(explained in the above doc), or Meteor's versions (`Meteor.setTimeout`, `Meteor.setInterval` etc), which we've wrapped to go via Famous.  We've also adapted `Meteor.defer`, `Meteor.setImmediate`, etc, so these are all safe to use.

Actually, you can quite liberally (but within reason) `defer` (using Meteor or Famous)
any code that doesn't require synchronosity to avoid single long running functions.

## Reactivity

One of the biggest problems when mixing Famous and Meteor is the latter's reactivity
blocking animation frames.  But don't worry, we've got you covered!  Famous-views
adapts Meteor's `Tracker` to work with the Famous animation loop, dividing up long
implicit flushes over multiple frames.

However, we have no control what happens in a single reactive callback,
particularly the ones you are writing yourself. But, we will detect and log
this for you (by default). You'll probably notice that for every break in
smooth animation, you have a log entry like this:

```
  debug:  [famous-views]  The following computation took 24ms to complete: function viewAutorun(c) wikiRender:materialize
```

You can tweak this output with the following options (default values below):

```js
  Tracker.warnOnLongComputations = true;       // log long-running computations
  Tracker.showComputationsInWarnings = false;  // Dump the full Computation object too
  Tracker.showFullFuncsInWarnings = false;     // Dump the actual function in full
```

Hopefully, you'll recognize the name of your custom function and can work to make parts of it asynchronous. showComputationsInWarnings might give you some more details you need.

## Routing & RenderController

We recommended a very simple way to
[integrate with iron-router](http://famous-views.meteor.com/features/iron-router)
to help get you up and running quickly; but the truth is, it's not the most performant
pattern, especially for complicated layouts.

In general, and especially for commonly shown and deeply nested layouts, make sure to
use `RenderController` in "PreRender Mode" (see [docs](/views/RenderController), at
the bottom).

But more than that, ensure route reactivity isn't causing needless reruns of template
helpers and/or layout.  This means, in iron-router, avoiding dependencies that will
cause your route's `data()` function and other reactive computations to run more than once.

MeteorHacks' [flow-router](https://github.com/meteorhacks/flow-router) embraces this
principle, minimizing reactive reruns and decoupling rendering from the router (which
is good, since we really want to hand that off to Famous).  You can find an example
of using Flow-Router with a RenderController in the
fview-flex [TabBar Demo](http://fview-flex.meteor.com/TabBar) and
[source](https://github.com/gadicc/fview-flex/tree/master/demo/client).

# Template Rendering

Complicated layouts are a killer.  So obey these two simple rules:

1. Prerender your templates (see Routing & RenderController, above).
1. Avoid reactivity that updates templates *during* animations and transitions.

So that means, animate/transition first and then update the template's reactive
deps, or the other way around.  Don't try get them to happen at the same time.

Moving forward, we'd love for this to be possible.  The problem is that Blaze
updates the DOM continuously during redraws, and as you know the Pitfalls guide
above, the DOM is sloooow.  The good news is that the MDG team is currently
researching on how to best move forward.  We have some ideas of our own too.

React will definitely offer better performance (especially with a few mods to
it's patch function to work with Famous' animation loop), and there is a lot
of experimentation going on in the community combining React with Meteor now.
**But it's premature to jump ship!**  By all means, use React if it meets your
general needs better, but don't do it because of this section.  Our advice,
for now, is to *continue building your app as normal*.  There's a good chance
this will get solved for you with no further effort.  However, if you're
desparate for performance in production *right now* - and our other guidelines
haven't helped - do what you need to do.

## Tracking Performance

We'll warn you in the console if any of your reactive functions are blocking Famous frames
(see "Reactivity", above).  Beyond that, check out
[fview-lagometer](https://github.com/gadicc/fview-lagometer).  In short,
`meteor add gadicohen:fview-lagometer`, and then press `Alt-L` in your app to toggle
a realtime FPS display in the upper right hand corner.  Props to @IjzerenHein for this!
